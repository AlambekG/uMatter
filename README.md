uMatter app was created by uniX team at junctionAsia2022.
Well-being, which has been linked to higher levels of employee engagement, leads to higher employee productivity. 
Our team wants to present an app, which helps managers take care about their employees’ well-being. 
The workers need to take a survey, which asks indirect questions related to their current mental well-being on a weekly basis. 
The Microsoft Teams makes this possible, using the Power App the manager can connect the company to collect the data on employee well-being.
Gathered data will be visualized through Power Bi. According to the questionnaire result, the company can suggest various activities 
that help increase employee well-being.

There is another home page of manager. However before accessing the page he must needs to authorize with the password. On the home page of manager there are buttons: “Weekly report”, “Chilling”, “Help”.  

The Weekly report page shows the report form survey evaluation which is done weekly by employees. 

Chilling page provides suggestions for manager
